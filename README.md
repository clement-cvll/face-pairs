# face-pairs
A personal project to improve my Computer Vision skills and improve my pytorch knowledge.

Using data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset">Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW)</a>, I developped a Siamese Neural Network to predict if two faces are from the same person or not.
